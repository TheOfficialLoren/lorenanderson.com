<p>A branch off of nwpaintballseries.com is a utility Loren Anderson has made to keep track of paintball players, teams, and tournaments in the Northwest. To build the <a href="http://www.cdrstar.com/nwps/nwiddefault.aspx" target="_new">NWID</a> Loren used ASP.NET technology and VB.NET with MS Access.  The website is dynamic and driven from a populated database.  It uses forms for visitors to submit information which can be approved, edited, or deleted through a very complete admin section.</p>
<p>Note: This website was made by Loren Anderson to the specifications of the website's owner.</p>

<p>Note: This website was made by Loren Anderson to the specifications of the website's owner.  This website may no longer be available.</p>
